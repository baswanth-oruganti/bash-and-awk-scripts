1. This repository contains bash scripts for essential dynamics sampling to generate an input path for metadynamics using path collective variables. Note that snapshots should be selected such that the RMSD between two consecutive frames should be similar.

2. The input path for metadynamics can be generated using all the c-alpha atoms or all the non-H atoms

3. This repository also contain bash scripts for free-energy profile calculations from implicit solvent MD simulations
